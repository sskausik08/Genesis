Input
-----
-   Network topology graph (comprising of hosts, switches, links)

-   End-point (for a pair of end-points) based network-wide policies.
    For eg.

    -   ALLOW flows : $\exists Path(h1,h2)$ (Furthermore we can try to
        reason about shortest path)

    -   DENY flows : $\neg (\exists Path(h2,h3))$

    -   No infinite loops in the graph for a flow :
        $\forall s. \neg (\exists Path(s,s))$ (This is implicitly
        inferred if we can guarantee reachability. However, we can have
        valid finite loops in the graph (service chaining for example).
        We donâ€™t need to check for loops in the graph now. )

    -   Traffic isolation : Flows f1, f2 should not share a link in the
        path :
        $\neg (\exists l. l \in Links(f1) \wedge l \in Links(f2))$

    -   Flows pass through a waypoint (e.g Middlebox, firewall etc.) A
        extension of this is middlebox service chaining $\rightarrow$
        flow has to pass through a sequence of nodes.

    -   Support for multi-path for a single flow, where the multiple
        paths are isolated (no common links). For example, the policy
        can be that for Flow $f$, $f.tag = 1$ and $.f.tag =2$ traverse
        different paths in the network.

Output
------

The flow tables in the switches satisfying input policies.
