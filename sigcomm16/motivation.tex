In this section, we describe the type of policies that tenants and
network operators may wish to realize. %% For simplicity, we assume a
%% multi-tenant cloud set up, where both the tenants and the provider
%% wish to realize policies over their respective networks. However,
%% these policies, and our framework, are applicable to other settings,
%% e.g., enterprise networks with different departments imposing
%% different sets of policies.
We use \cref{fig:architecture} as a running example. This figure shows several
tenants who differ in the nature of policies they wish to realize. We
note that these policies reflect and, in some cases, extend the
policies that enterprises realize in their on-site networks today as
well as policies that data center operators support for the different
workloads they host~\cite{mpa-imc15}.  The policies include:

%\aditya{explain the figure here}.
%\kausik{Will do this now}

\aditya{define flow, flow group, policy etc here}
% \aditya{need to start by saying we focus on multi-tenant clouds, although our system can apply elsewhere too}

% Operators of enterprise and multi-tenant clouds deal with policy
% requirements of different organisations and tenants, as well as
% require support to manage the network for providing QoS guarantees and
% network resource management internally, invisible to the
% tenants. Network operators need to be able to express complex policies
% in an intuitive declarative fashion, and the network management system
% must derive the individual switch forwarding behavior without
% involving the operator.


\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Reachability}: This enables network communication
  between specific groups of a tenant's virtual cloud instances,
  applications, or hosts. For example, the yellow tenant has defined a reachability
  policy for its VMs ($V1 >> V2$), which is translated by the operator after 
  placement as $E2 >> E4$.
\item \textbf{Middlebox traversals}: A tenant may wish that traffic
  between two of her endpoints, or from another tenant, must traverse
  through specific middleboxes (locations, or logical descriptors) for
  security, access control or performance reasons. This can be
  specified via an ordered sequence of sets of middleboxes for a flow
  group to traverse, where the middleboxes in a set can be traversed
  in any order, but all middleboxes in the set must be traversed.  The
  unordered set abstraction leverages the fact that middleboxes
  without dependencies in their traffic processing behavior can be
  placed in any order in a service chain~\cite{pga}. Thus the
  middlebox traversal specification outlined here generalizes the
  notion of a service chain. For example, the grey tenant in \cref{fig:architecture}
  defines a waypoint policy $V1 >> FW; [IDS,BC] >> V2$
   which specifies that traffic must first pass through the firewall(FW),
  and then the set of IDS and byte counter (BC) in any order. 

  %% \aditya{refer here to an example in
  %%   the figure} In several cases \loris{how true is this?} the order
  %% in which these middle-boxes is traversed is not relevant and the
  %% policy language should therefore support unordered waypoints.

\item \textbf{Isolation}: Tenants may require various QoS guarantees
  that enforce varying degrees of isolation for their traffic. In the
  extreme, a tenant could ensure that her flow groups are not affected
  by any other tenant by strictly isolating the path of the tenant's
  flows from others' flows. In \cref{fig:architecture}, we have two tenants
  each with one traffic class which will be isolated from one another, that is
  they will not share any links in the topology. 
  A tenant could also specify isolation for a subset of her
  (performance-sensitive) flows from other flows of her own deployment
  or those belonging to other tenants; the rest of the tenants' flows
  may require no guarantees.

%%   There has been a rising emergence of 
%% multi-tenant clouds, which is more economical for tenants to use
%% rather than managing their own private datacenters. However,
%% the current Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
%% provided to tenants are centered around compute, storage, or
%% external traffic bandwidth. Lack of guarantees on the network
%% between tenant instances leads to unpredictability of performance
%% for distributed applications. Also, multi-tenant clouds are
%% susceptible to attacks on the network by malicious tenants who could
%% hog the internal network bandwidth, or conduct side-channel
%% attacks~\cite{heyyou-ccs}.
% Conventionally,
% this problem is mitigated by static rate-limiting, but it can lead
% to under-utilisation of resources.
%% Cloud provider can offer (paying) tenants various QoS guarantees
%% that enforce varying degrees of tenant isolation. In the extreme,
%% this could ensure that a tenant's performance is not affected by
%% any other tenant by strictly isolating the path of tenant's flows
%% from others' flows. \aditya{refer here to an example in
%% 	the figure} The tenant could also specify isolation for certain
%%  performance-sensitive flows, while the rest of the tenant-flows
%%   would be without guarantees with varying degrees of pricing. 
%%   Thus, support for isolation is an important feature in multi-tenant 
%%   networks. 
 \end{itemize}
%TODO : MODIFY Synthesis of waypoints to support logical waypoints
%% Since, cloud tenants do not have a view of the actual physical
%% topology, the policy requirements for tenants are at a coarser level
%% of control. While support for the above policies can be used to satisfy tenant
%% SLAs, network operators can benefit from a fine-grained
%% control of network resources, integrated with support for tenant specifications 
%% for effective management of the network. \newline

\textbf{Network Resource Management}: While support for the above
policies can be used to satisfy tenant SLAs, network operators can
benefit from a fine-grained control of network resources, integrated
with support for tenant specifications for effective management of the
network. For instance, to aid traffic enginerring, the network
operator may specify policies constraining the maximum number of
tenant flows that can traverse a given link or sets of links in the
network. She may also wish to ensure traffic from some sensitive
applications does not contend for bandwidth on constrained links with
elastic traffic from batch applications. For example, in \cref{fig:architecture},
there are two low-bandwidth links in the datacenter, and the operator
specifies policies to ensure that flows traversing $A2 \rightarrow C2$ 
and $A2 \rightarrow C4$ do not exceed the link capacity of 100.
          %% capacity
          %% of certain links such that tenant flows using the link do
          %% not exceed the capacity of the link. Such policies can be
          %% useful to ensure the low bandwidth links are not used by
          %% more tenants such that their performance is affected and
          %% can be used to provide bandwidth guarantees to tenants.
  Likewise, to tackle hardware heterogeniety, operators can specify
  switch constraint policies, like the size of the rule table to
  restrict the number of flows traversing a particular switch or set
  of switches.
%\item \textbf{Network Maintenance}: \aditya{this whole para does not
%    parse and needs updating} Operators on a regular basis perform link and
%  switch maintenances, and need to ensure that during maintenance, the network still
%  conforms to the SLAs of the tenants and resource capacity
%  policies.   \aditya{the following sentence does not make sense} Using Genesis, the operator
%  can specify the links and switches that will be down for maintenance, and Genesis can synthesize 
%  the rules for the updated network with all policies satisfies, which then can be pushed to 
%  the network before maintenance. 
%\end{itemize}

  Our goal is to design a system that allows the above policies to be
  specified in a simple, declarative manner, and abstracts away 
  data plane enforcement and the intricacies thereof.
  
\subsection{Synthesis} \label{sec:synthesis} 

\input{policy}


Providing support for realizing the complex set of policies using
existing SDN programming languages like Pyretic and Frenetic is
challenging, because these policies are global and cannot be enforced
by programming individual behaviour of switches. Existing network
management systems provide support for complex policies including
middlebox placement and bandwidth constraints~\cite{}; however these
are tailor-made for certain policies and lack generality and
extensibility.

We design a general network management system that realizes the above
sets of policies by performing {\em synthesis} of switch forwarding
rules to enforce end-to-end policies. The system architecture of \name
is shown in \cref{fig:architecture} and the way in which policies
outlined in the previous section can be specified in \name is shown in
Table~\ref{tab:policysupport} .

Unlike previous efforts in the synthesis space (see~\cite{}), \Name is
not tailored to specific formalisms such as regular expressions and
this aspect makes it modular and easily extensible.
%and allows to devise specific
%techniques for each type of policies. 
To draw an analogy with SMT solvers, \Name can be seen as a constraint
solver that allows the addition different types of policies
(respectively, the theories in SMT) and that allows the design of
different types of optimizations based on the properties desired by cloud
  operators using \Name. 
  
Our work is motivated by recent progress in program synthesis.
Program synthesis is defined as the task of discovering an executable
program from user intent expressed in the form of some
constraints. There are three key dimensions to synthesis: the kind of
constraints that it accepts as expression of user intent, the space of
programs over which it searches, and the search technique it
employs. Program synthesis has seen limited applications to networks,
specifically to controller synthesis~\cite{netegg}, where the idea is
to learn from examples and synthesize the behavior of individual
switches (e.g., learning switches or firewalls); furthermore, this
technique applies to networks operating in a reactive mode (where the
first packet of a connection is processed by the controller to
determine the actions to employ). Like Frenetic~\cite{} and
Pyretic~\cite{}, this switch-centric approach is too constraining.

\Name\ leverages synthesis at a high level as follows: given a set of
policies which describe user intent, the search space is the space of
all forwarding plane configurations and the search technique involved
is SAT/SMT solving. The solution found is implemented by installing
the necessary switch rules via a skeleton controller.

This approach is appealing for a variety of different reasons: 

(1)
Policies useful to operators are \emph{proactive} (i.e., they are not
dependent on the actual packet flow), and our synthesis approach
naturally aligns with such proactive policies.

%  and this enables enforcing policies by synthesis
% of switch-table rules, and using a skeleton SDN controller to deploy
% the forwarding rules to the switches. In contrast, in trying to
% synthesize reactive policies (like a firewall), the controller needs
% to store the state of flows it has received and have a control module
% following the specifications \aditya{huh? this doesn't make sense...},
% which is an interesting synthesis problem, but orthogonal to our
% approach.

(2) Correct policy enforcement is challenging due to different
objectives for each of the policies - ensuring isolation between flows
may lead to overshooting capacity and vice-versa - and is a common
cause of incorrect configurations in networks.  Our approach removes
the need for a verification step in which the operator has to
``check'' whether an attempted configuration meets the desired
policies.  By using a formal reasoning technique, we are able to
consider the space of all forwarding configurations and find a
solution which is \emph{correct by construction}, i.e., it adheres to
satisfying a diverse set of policies, eliminating the room for error
by the network operator.

(3) Automatically enforcing policies is a task with
\emph{high theoretical complexity}. 
For example, enforcing isolation policies
is as hard as solving
graph-coloring, a well-known
NP-complete problem (see \cref{sec:isolationNP} for the proof).
%, which means
%that any system solving this would need to exhaustively search the
%space of all forwarding plane configurations. 
Many search techniques can be used to find the forwarding rules when
handling a particular class of policies, but when multiple types of
policies are combined (isolation, middlebox traversal, capacity
constraints), devising good search techniques becomes challenging.
Thanks to the many engineering efforts, SMT solvers abstract away most
of this complexity and allow us to unify the search objectives for
every policy into a generalized search technique.
%Thus, by reducing this problem to a SMT instance and
%leveraging fast off-the-shelf SMT solvers developed over years of
%research, \Name can provide support for diverse policies required by
%network operators. 
Crucially, \Name can be extended with ease to
support new policies without requiring changes to the search
techniques to find the solution.

%% in the sense that we support theories (the policies) and now people can work on engineering
%% the solver for different classes of policies.
%% }
%% \kausik{To flow from this subsec to the next? Support for policies is 
%% 	inbuilt, but operators can engineer tactics to suit their needs. Is this what you want to convey?}
%% \loris{I found many words used to address the same concept:
%% enforce the policies, synthesize rules, etc...
%% try to be uniform or it's quite hard to understand what is being done.

%% \kausik{I think "enforce policies" would be better? The title explains the rest.}

\subsection{Performance Challenges} \label{sec:performance}

One of the key challenges of \Name is the synthesis
performance. 
Due to the rich  policies supported by \Name
finding a consistent set of switch forwarding rules 
has exponential time worst case complexity in
the number of policies.
Moreover, since policies such as isolation affect
the paths many different flows, it is not possible to incrementally synthesize
the forwarding rules corresponding to each flow. 
Despite the recent advances in SMT solvers, to make
the synthesis problem feasible in practice,
there is a need to improve the performance of the solver
using techniques that are specific to the network domain.
\loris{I rewrote this previous paragraph}


In this paper, we propose various techniques leveraging
\emph{domain-specific} knowledge to improve synthesis performance. We
propose the idea of \emph{tactics} (\cref{sec:tactic}), which are
search strategies leveraging the network structure of datacenter
topologies, to specify properties of the paths for the reachability
policies.  Tactics are a way for network operators to specify a
high-level constraint on the set of paths allowed for reachability
policies.  Path properties are expressed using a simplified form of
regular expressions which, after being converted into a finite
automata, can be used to simplify the set of constraints provided to
the solver.  In particular, one can eliminate constraints that cannot
be true for any of the paths accepted by the automaton language. We
find that this can result in \aditya{XXX} speedup. \aditya{fill this
  in!} 


Another property of datacenter topologies is that the huge
interconnect of links can lead to multiple solutions to the problem
(i.e., to enforce the policies provided).  To take advantage of this
property, we design a heuristic procedure called \emph{optimistic}
synthesis (\cref{sec:optimistic}) which leverages the structure of
isolation policy interactions among tenants to partition the input
policies into effective components and synthesize these components
faster than the complete problem. To improve the effectiveness of the
heuristic, whenever the SMT solver fails to find a solution we extract
the unsatisfiability core produced by the SMT solver and 
add it to our set of constraints to quickly converge to a correct solution.
Informally, the unsatisfiability core can be viewed
as a set of constraints that describes why there wasn't a feasible solution~\cite{}.
