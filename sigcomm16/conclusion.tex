\section{Conclusion}

We presented \Name, a general and extensible network management system
for enterprise-scale multi-tenant datacenter networks. It allows
rich policies to be specified declaratively. It leverages
the formal reasoning foundations of constraint solving together with
fast SMT solvers to synthesize data plane configuration from high
level policies. This abstracts away the difficult task of programming or
configuring individual switches. \Name incorporates novel ideas to
speed up synthesis, leveraging the hierarchical nature of datacenter
network topologies and the structure of the interaction between
tenants' policies. These optimizations help \Name synthesize policies
for realistic settings in a few seconds, making it practical to use in
network management.

%   Operators in multi-tenant cloud data centers require support for
%   diverse and complex end-to-end policies like reachability, middlebox
%   traversals, isolation, and network resource management. We present
%   \Name, a network management system which allows these policies to be
%   specified in a declarative manner without explicitly programming the
%   data-plane behavior.  \name tackles the problem of enforcing the
%   policies by synthesizing switch forwarding tables. In doing so, it
%   uses the formal reasoning foundations of constraint solving in
%   combination with fast off-the-shelf SMT solvers.  To improve
%   synthesis performance, \Name incorporates a novel search strategy that
%   uses regular expressions to specify properties that leverage the
%   structure of datacenter networks,
% %topologies to specify properties of the path 
%   and a heuristic synthesis procedure which exploits the structure of
%   policy interactions.  Experiments demonstrate the performance of
%   \Name with different workloads on real-world topologies. Overall,
%   the approach used by \Name is general and instrumental to building a
%   comprehensive network management system.
