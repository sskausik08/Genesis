\section{Conclusion}


\section{Future Work}
There are numerous directions of future research in the area of synthesis for policy enforcement. 
One of them is achieving optimality of the forwarding plane
 in terms of path lengths or datacenter utilisation using different techniques like MaxSMT. Another interesting area
 is efficient incremental synthesis due to changes in policy or topological events like switch/link failures 
 which require a change in network configuration.
