\section{Evaluation}
We now evaluate the performance of Genesis along various dimensions:
 (1) What is the performance of Genesis in synthesizing simple reachability and waypoint policies
  with increasing number of policies and greater sizes of topologies and benchmarking the constraints used by the synthesis algorithm? 
  (2) How quickly can Genesis synthesize isolation policies in datacenter topologies for varying number of policies and percentage of
   datacenter utilization? 
   (3) What is the performance of Genesis for solving link-capacity policies in internet topologies? 
   (4) Identifying the benefits of tactics in terms of reduction of terms in the synthesis algorithm and actual benefits 
   with respect to synthesis without tactics for different isolation workloads in datacenter topologies? 
   (5) What are the potential speedups of using optimistic synthesis in Genesis for varying workloads?
