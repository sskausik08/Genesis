  {\bf Abstract---} Operators in multi-tenant cloud datacenters require support for
  diverse and complex end-to-end policies like reachability, middlebox
  traversals, isolation, traffic engineering and
   network resource management. We present
  \Name, a network management system which allows policies to be
  specified in a declarative manner without explicitly programming the
  data-plane.  \name tackles the problem of enforcing the
  policies by synthesizing switch forwarding tables. In doing so, it
  uses the formal reasoning foundations of constraint solving in
  combination with fast off-the-shelf SMT solvers.  To improve
  synthesis performance, \Name incorporates a novel search strategy that
  uses regular expressions to specify properties that leverage the
  structure of datacenter networks,
%topologies to specify properties of the path 
  and a divide-and-conquer synthesis procedure which exploits the structure of
  policy interactions.  Experiments demonstrate the performance of
  \Name with different workloads on real-world topologies. Overall,
  the approach used by \Name is general and instrumental to building a
  comprehensive network management system.
