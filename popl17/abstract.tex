  {\bf Abstract---} Operators in multi-tenant cloud datacenters
  require support for diverse and complex end-to-end policies, such
  as, reachability, middlebox traversals, isolation, traffic
  engineering, and network resource management. We present \Name, a
  datacenter network management system which allows policies to be
  specified in a declarative manner without explicitly programming the
  network data plane.  \name tackles the problem of enforcing policies
  by synthesizing switch forwarding tables. It uses the formal
  foundations of constraint solving in combination with fast
  off-the-shelf SMT solvers.  To improve synthesis performance, \Name
  incorporates a novel search strategy that uses regular expressions
  to specify properties that leverage the structure of datacenter
  networks,
%topologies to specify properties of the path 
  and a divide-and-conquer synthesis procedure which exploits the
  structure of policy relationships.  We have prototyped \Name, and conducted
  experiments with a variety of workloads on real-world topologies
  to demonstrate its  performance.
  %% Overall, the approach used by \Name is general and instrumental
  %% to building a comprehensive network management system.
