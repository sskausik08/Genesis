\section{Policy-compliant Resiliency}
Datacenter networks are highly prone to failures~\cite{datacenterfailures}, 
and it is crucial to provide certain guarantees during failure
scenarios. For example, if the operator wants to guarantee
reachability amongst endpoints, the controller only has to find an active
path in the network to re-establish reachability. 
However, upon the failure of a link, {\em reactively} synthesizing a new configuration which satisfies
all input policies can be prohibitively expensive.
Thus, we propose 
\emph{policy-compliant resiliency} to tackle network failures
by \emph{proactively} synthesizing resilient data planes that, even in the event
of bounded number of link failures, do not violate input policies. This eliminates the 
need to resynthesize the forwarding
configuration for every network failure event.

In this section, we describe the transformation of input 
policies to provide $t-resilience$, i.e in the event of upto arbitary
$t$ link failures, the synthesized data plane still has a path
for each packet class  satisfying all policies. We only consider reachability, waypoint,
and isolation policies in the input. Global policies like capacity constraints
and traffic engineering pose a difficulty as the synthesis will consider
all backup paths in consideration, while all backup paths will not 
exist together in the network (backup paths will be deployed during
a failure event).\loris{don't understand previous sentence} 

Given the physical topology $T=(S,L)$, a link-failure
scenario $\theta$ is defined as a set of failed links $\theta = \{l_1, l_2 \ldots ... l_n\}$,
such that $\forall i.\ l_i \in L$.
% For $t-resilience$, we need to
%consider synthesis under any set of $t$ or less arbitary link failures.
%\begin{mydef}
	We define $\Theta(t)$ as the set of all failure scenarios where no more than $t$
	arbitary links fail, i.e $\Theta(t) = \{ \ \theta \ \ | \ \ |\theta| \leq t\}$.
%\end{mydef}
%We define the projected topology $T^{\theta} = (S, L - \theta)$ as the active 
%physical topology under the failure scenario $\theta$. 	For each class $pc$,
%we construct a data plane graph $\xi = (S, L_{pc})$ for packet class $pc$ from the set
%of paths obtained from the synthesis algorithm. $\xi$
%for class $pc$ over a projected topology $T^\theta$ 
%is resilient if the graph $(S, L_{pc} - \theta)$ has a path from $src$ to $dst$ 
%for the packet class. 
Given a packet class $pc$,
let $\xi = (S, L_{pc})$ be the induced data plane graph obtained
by taking all the links for class $pc$ returned by the synthesis algorithm. For a failure scenario
$\theta$, the active data plane $\xi_\theta = (S, L_{pc} \setminus \theta)$ represents
all the links used by $\xi$ which are unaffected by the failure scenario. A data
plane $\xi$ is {\em resilient} to $\theta$ if it contains a path from the source to 
destination for the packet class in the active data plane $\xi_\theta$.
\begin{mydef}[Resilience]
	A data plane $\xi = (S, L_{pc})$ for class $pc$ is $t-resilient$ if $\xi$ is 
	resilient to all $\theta \in \Theta(t)$.
\end{mydef}
\begin{mydef}[Policy-compliance]
	A data plane $\xi = (S, L_{pc})$ for class $pc$ is policy-complaint if under
	any failure scenario $\theta \in \Theta(t)$, \loris{any path?} the path for $pc$ in 
	$\xi_\theta=(S, L_{pc} \setminus \theta)$ satisfies the input policies. 
\end{mydef}

 We now show how \Name can be modified to provide $t-resilience$.
Intuitively, this  is done by modifying the input policies so that  multiple disjoint paths satisfying the original
policies are synthesized for each packet class.
 The transformation of input policies $(PC, I) \xRightarrow{res} (PC^R, I^R)$ to provide $t-resilience$ to the packet classes is described in \Cref{restransform}. 
\name leverages link-isolation to provide $t+1$ edge-disjoint paths for packet classes which satisfy all input policies.  
The synthesized data plane $\hat{\xi} = (S, L_{pc})$ for class $pc$ is constructed from the 
paths in resilient packet class set $\hat{pc} = \{rc_1,\ldots,rc_{t+1}\}$ (line~\ref{lst:line:respc}).
i.e $L_{pc} = \sum\limits_{rc \in \hat{pc}} L_{rc}$. 
Each path of $\hat{pc}$ satisfies the reachability/waypoint policy, and any arbitary $t$ link failure scenario cannot affect all $t+1$ paths of $\hat{pc}$.
By adding isolation policies amongst the resilient set of two different classes $pc_1$ and $pc_2$, any path from the sets
would satisfy the isolation policy $pc_1 || \ pc_2$.
\Cref{fig:restransform}(a) demonstrates an example transformation for providing $1-resilience$. 

\begin{theorem}[Soundness]
\loris{Given....}
	For all packet classes $pc \in PC$, the data plane $\hat{\xi}$ is $t-resilient$ 
	and policy-compliant. 
\end{theorem}
\noindent If there are no isolation policies in the input, the resilience transformation in lines 
\ref{lst:line:respc}-\ref{lst:line:respcend} of \Cref{restransform} is complete.
\begin{theorem}[Completeness]
\loris{What is the input? You should say.
Given .... such that ...., the synthesized data plane... is....if and only if...}
If there are no isolation policies $I = \emptyset$, 
	for a packet classes $pc$, the data plane \loris{what dataplane?} is $t-resilient$ only if it 
	contains $t + 1$ edge-disjoint paths for $pc$.
\end{theorem}

\noindent The transformation demonstrated in \Cref{restransform} is not \emph{complete}
 if the original policies contain link-isolation policies i.e if the transformed policies
 is unsatisfiable, that does not imply the non-existence of resilient data planes. 
 \Cref{fig:restransform}(b) shows a  transformation required for $1-resilience$ 
 with fewer additional link-isolation policies among different classes
 of $pc_1$ and $pc_2$. Consider a failure scenario which disables path
 of $pc_{1A}$. By virtue of the link-isolation policies, $pc_{1B}$ and
 $pc_{2A}$ will be unaffected and can be used as paths for $pc_1$ 
 and $pc_2$ respectively, and $pc_1 <> pc_2$ holds. Now suppose
 $pc_{1B}$ is affected. Similarily, $pc_{1A}$ and $pc_{2A}$ can be used as
 the paths for the original packet classes. The same scenarios hold symmetrically
 for $pc_2$, and thus the resilience transformation can be achieved without
 adding link-isolation policies amongst all the packet classes. Therefore,
 the resilience transformation proposed in \Cref{restransform} is sound but not
 complete when the input policies comprises of isolation policies.

We presented a sound transformation of policies to provide $t-resilience$ in
the case of reachability, waypoint and isolation policies. Future directions of 
research involve incorporating capacity constraints and traffic engineering
for synthesis of resilient data planes, and finding a complete transformation of
link-isolation policies.
