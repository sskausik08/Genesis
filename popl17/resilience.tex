\section{Policy-compliant Resiliency}
Datacenter networks are highly prone to failures\cite{datacenterfailures}, 
and it is crucial to ensure certain guarantees during failure
scenarios. For example, if the operator wants to guarantee
reachability amongst endpoints, the controller only has to find a active
path in the network to re-establish reachability. 
However, {\em reactively} synthesizing a new configuration which satisfies
all input policies can be prohibitively expensive.
Thus, we propose 
\emph{policy-compliant resiliency} to tackle network failures
by \emph{proactively} synthesizing resilient data planes such that in the event
of bounded number of failures, the data plane would consist of a 
path which does not violate input policies. This eliminates the 
need to resynthesize the forwarding
configuration for every network failure event.

In the section, we describe the transformation of input 
policies to provide $t-resilience$, i.e in the event of upto arbitary
$t$ link failures, the synthesized data plane will have a path
for each packet class  satisfying all policies. We only consider reachability, waypoint
and isolation policies in the input. Global policies like capacity constraints
and traffic engineering pose a difficulty as the synthesis will consider
all backup paths in consideration, while all backup paths will not 
exist together in the network (backup paths will be deployed during
a failure event). 

Given the physical topology $T=(S,L)$, a link-failure
scenario $\theta = \{l_1, l_2 \ldots ... l_n\},\ \forall i.\ l_i \in L$ 
denotes the set of links failed. For $t-resilience$, we need to
consider synthesis under any set of $t$ or less arbitary link failures.
\begin{mydef}
	We define $\Theta(t)$ as the set of all failure scenarios where not more than $t$
	arbitary links fail, i.e $\Theta(t) = \{ \ \theta \ \ | \ \ |\theta| \leq t\}$
\end{mydef}
We define the projected topology $T^{\theta} = (S, L - \theta)$ as the active 
physical topology under the failure scenario $\theta$. 	For each class $pc$,
we construct a data plane graph $\xi = (S, L_{pc})$ for packet class $pc$ from the set
of paths obtained from the synthesis algorithm. $\xi$
for class $pc$ over a projected topology $T^\theta$ 
is resilient if the graph $(S, L_{pc} - \theta)$ has a path from $src$ to $dst$ 
for the packet class. 
\begin{mydef}[Resilience]
	A data plane $\xi = (S, L_{pc})$ for class $pc$ is $t-resilient$ if $\xi$ is 
	resilient over projected topologies $T^\theta,\ \forall \theta \in \Theta(t)$.
\end{mydef}
\begin{mydef}[Policy-compliance]
	A data plane $\xi = (S, L_{pc})$ for class $pc$ is policy-complaint if $\xi$ has 
	a path over projected topologies $T^\theta,\ \forall \theta \in \Theta(t)$ which
	satisfies the input policies for $pc$. 
\end{mydef}

\noindent The transformation of input policies $(PC, I) \xRightarrow{res} (PC^R, I^R)$ to provide $t-resilience$ to the packet classes is described in \Cref{restransform}. 
\name leverages link-isolation to provide $t+1$ edge-disjoint paths for packet classes which satisfy all input policies.  
The synthesized data plane $\hat{\xi} = (S, L_{pc})$ for class $pc$ is constructed from the 
paths in resilient packet class set $\hat{pc} = \{rc_1,\ldots,rc_{t+1}\}$ (line~\ref{lst:line:respc}).
i.e $L_{pc} = \sum\limits_{rc \in \hat{pc}} L_{rc}$. 
Each path of $\hat{pc}$ satisfies the reachability/waypoint policy, and any arbitary $t$ link failure scenario cannot affect all $t+1$ paths of $\hat{pc}$.
By adding isolation policies amongst the resilient set of two different classes $pc_1$ and $pc_2$, any path from the sets
would satisfy the isolation policy $pc_1 || \ pc_2$.
\Cref{fig:restransform}(a) demonstrates an example transformation for providing $1-resilience$. 

\begin{theorem}[Soundness]
	For all packet classes $pc \in PC$, the data plane $\hat{\xi}$ is $t-resilient$ 
	and policy-compliant. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Assume a data plane $\hat{\xi} = (S, L_{pc})$ of packet class $pc$ is not $t-resilient$. 
	Therefore, there exists a failure scenario $\theta$ such that $|\theta| \leq t$ 
	and  the $\hat{\xi}$ over the projected topology $T^\theta$ 
	is not resilient, i.e there is no path from the source to destination for
	$pc$ in $(S,L_{pc} - \theta)$.
	Thus, $\theta$ disabled all the paths in $\hat{pc}$. \\
	However, the paths are
	edge-disjoint as each class in $\hat{pc}$ has a link-isolation policy with each 
	other. This is a contradiction, as $t$ link failures cannot affect $t+1$ 
	edge-disjoint paths of $\hat{pc}$. \\
	Let us consider policy-compliance. Given a failure scenario $\theta \in \Theta(t)$, each data plane $\xi$ of class $pc$ has an active path. Consider a isolation policy in $I$: $pc_1 || \ pc_2$. In line~\ref{lst:line:respolicy} of \Cref{restransform}, each class of $\hat{pc_1}$ will be isolated to
	each class of $\hat{pc_2}$, thus any path of the data planes of $pc_1$ and
	$pc_2$ will satisfy the input policy $pc_1 || \ pc_2$. Hence, the data planes 
	are policy-compliant. 
\end{proof}
\noindent If there are no isolation policies in the input, the resilience transformation in lines 
\ref{lst:line:respc}-\ref{lst:line:respcend} of \Cref{restransform} is complete.
\begin{theorem}[Completeness]
If there are no isolation policies $I = \emptyset$, 
	for a packet classes $pc$, the data plane is $t-resilient$ only if it 
	contains $t + 1$ edge-disjoint paths for $pc$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let us assume the data-plane $\xi$ for $pc$ is $t-resilient$ such 
	that less than $t+1$ instances of $pc$ are required for resilience i.e. 
	$|\hat{pc}| < t+1$. Let us consider a 
	t-link failure scenario $\theta, |\theta| = t$ where a link is picked from
	each path of $\hat{pc}$. There is no path in $\xi$ in the projected
	topology $T^\theta$. This is a contradiction since $\xi$ is $t-resilient$. 
	Therefore, we need atleast $t+1$ instances of $pc$ to ensure $t-resilience$.
	
	Now let us assume there are $t+1$ paths in a $t-resilient$ $\xi$ for $pc$,
	and not all of them are edge-disjoint. Consider two paths $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$
	in $\xi$ which share a link. We can choose $t-1$ links from the other $t-1$ paths 
	and construct a failure scenario $\theta$, $|\theta| = t$. 
	There is no path in $\xi$ in the projected
	topology $T^\theta$. This is a contradiction since $\xi$ is $t-resilient$. Therefore,
	the $t+1$ paths of $pc$ must be edge-disjoint. 
	
	\noindent Thus, the resilience transformation is complete for a  
	packet class if there are no isolation policies.
\end{proof}
\noindent The transformation demonstrated in \Cref{restransform} is not \emph{complete}
 if the original policies contain link-isolation policies i.e if the transformed policies
 is unsatisfiable, that does not imply the non-existence of resilient data planes. 
 \Cref{fig:restransform}(b) shows a  transformation required for $1-resilience$ 
 with fewer additional link-isolation policies among different classes
 of $pc_1$ and $pc_2$. Consider a failure scenario which disables path
 of $pc_{1A}$. By virtue of the link-isolation policies, $pc_{1B}$ and
 $pc_{2A}$ will be unaffected and can be used as paths for $pc_1$ 
 and $pc_2$ respectively, and $pc_1 <> pc_2$ holds. Now suppose
 $pc_{1B}$ is affected. Similarily, $pc_{1A}$ and $pc_{2A}$ can be used as
 the paths for the original packet classes. The same scenarios hold symmetrically
 for $pc_2$, and thus the resilience transformation can be achieved without
 adding link-isolation policies amongst all the packet classes. Therefore,
 the resilience transformation proposed in \Cref{restransform} is sound but not
 complete when the input policies comprises of isolation policies.

We presented a sound transformation of policies to provide $t-resilience$ in
the case of reachability, waypoint and isolation policies. Future directions of 
research involve incorporating capacity constraints and traffic engineering
for synthesis of resilient data planes, and finding a complete transformation of
link-isolation policies.
