\section{Policy-compliant Resiliency}
Datacenter networks are highly prone to failures, 
and it is crucial to ensure certain guarantees during such failure
situations. For example, if the operator want to guarantee
reachability amongst endpoints, the controller has to find a active
path in the network to re-establish reachability. However, if the new
paths must still satisfy tenant SLAs like isolation, this may require 
changing paths of other classes which were unaffected by the failure event,
and in the worst case, can incur an exponential complexity.
While \name provides a systematic and correct approach
to enforcing policies, the implications of using SMT solvers is that
it is very difficult to be able to synthesize configuration repairs to
network failures \emph{reactively} in a bounded amount of time. 
Instead, we propose a \emph{proactive} approach 
of support for \emph{policy-compliant resiliency} to tackle network failures
by synthesizing alternate paths which satisfy the input policies, such that the SDN controller 
can choose an alternate path in the scenario of a link/switch failure.

\begin{mydef}
	$t-resilience$ synthesis for a packet class is defined as the
	synthesis of paths such that in the event of upto arbitary
	$t$ link failures, there exists a synthesized path for the packet class which
	satisfies the input policies.
