\section{Conclusion}
We presented \name, a system for automatically synthesizing 
highly-resilient distributed hierarchical control planes---i.e., OSPF and 
BGP router configurations---from
high-level policies. For hierarchical control planes, 
we devised algorithms based on our OSPF-BGP interaction model. In 
practice, there exists hierarchical models, we can integrate these routing
models into \name's modular two-phase approach.
Similarly, we can modify OSPF synthesis to incorporate multi-path routing
for load-balancing etc. Finally, resilience is an important requirement, 
and extending \name to support other notions of policy-resilience
for $k > 1$ link failures is subject for future work.
