\begin{theorem}[Hardness of synthesis]
\label{thm:ospfsynth}
Given a
network with a single domain,
and a positive number $k$,
the problem generating
a path-compliant configuration with at most $k$ static routes
is NP-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Hardness of domain assignments]
\label{thm:multidom}
	Given a
	network and  set of paths  $\Pi$,
	the problem of generating a domain assignment for which
	there exists a 
	configuration that is path-compliant with $\Pi$ with no static routes
	is NP-complete.
