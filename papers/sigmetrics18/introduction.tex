\section{Introduction}
Programming networks to correctly forward flows according to user- and
application-induced policies is difficult and
error-prone~\cite{troubleshooting, bgpmisconfig}. 
At least three
common characteristics of network policies are to blame: (1) A network
may need to satisfy several types of policies, including reachability
(i.e., which endpoints can communicate), isolation (i.e., which flows
cannot share links), service chaining (i.e., which ``middleboxes'',
e.g., firewalls or load balancers, must be traversed), resilience
(e.g., number of available backup paths), and traffic engineering
(e.g., minimizing average link utilization). (2) The network must
provide certain guarantees in the event of failures. Ideally, every
set of forwarding paths (i.e., data plane) installed in the network
should conform to these policies, otherwise performance, security, or
availability problems may arise. (3) Most policies are global---i.e.,
they concern end-to-end paths, not individual devices/links.

The global nature of network policies is one motivation for
software-defined networking (SDN). SDN allows paths to be centrally
computed over a global view of the network. However, ensuring paths
are correctly computed and installed in the presence of failures is
difficult in practice, even if the SDN controller is
distributed~\cite{hasdn}.  Traditional control planes rely on
distributed protocols such as Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to compute paths; these protocols
typically employ variants of least cost path computation, and react to
failures by recomputing least cost paths and installing forwarding
state in routers that induces the paths. In contrast to centralized
SDN, traditional control planes offer greater fault tolerance; but,
determining the appropriate distributed realization of policies is
hard~\cite{propane}.

Our high-level goal is to develop a system to {\em automate the
  process of creating a correct and failure-resilient distributed
  realization of policies in a traditional control plane}. To be
useful, such a system must satisfy a few key requirements. First, it
must handle a wide range of commonly-used policies---including
reachability, service chaining, and traffic engineering---to meet
applications' diverse security and compliance requirements. Second, it
must ensure that configurations are resilient to network malfunctions
such as link failures. Third, it
must provide support for realizing hierarchical control planes---
where a network is split into several ``domains'' atop which a
hierarchy of intra- and inter-domain control plane configurations 
is deployed---to ensure
scalability for large networks~\cite{routingdesign}. 
Finally, to improve manageability and network
cost-effectiveness~\cite{mpa-imc15,complexity:sigcomm11}, it must
ensure that configurations obey certain general
rules-of-thumb~\cite{complexity:nsdi09}, e.g., limiting the number of
lines of configurations and the use of certain configuration
constructs.


Thus, our work contrasts with prior efforts~\cite{netegg, propane,
  merlin, simple, fattire, netkat, netkatcompiler, sol}, which suffer
from one or more of these issues: they generate SDN- or BGP-specific
control planes for a limited range of policies (e.g., peering); do not
attempt to be resilient to failures; do not support generating
hierarchical control planes; and do not enable generation of
simple-to-manage network configurations. 

The problem of synthesizing router configurations for which the
distributed control plane is resilient to failures and generates
policy-compliant paths is computationally hard. Even
generating a set of policy-compliant paths for an SDN is
computationally hard---e.g., enforcing isolated paths is NP-complete.
Bringing ideas from program synthesis approaches, one could try to 
synthesize configurations using 
Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers, which
provide support for 
constraint solving for propositional logic (SAT)
and linear rational arithmetic (LRA). 

However, there are major challenges 
to synthesizing configurations 
directly from policies.  
To infer the concrete set of paths induced by network
configurations, one has to incorporate into synthesis complex
concepts---e.g., reasoning about shortest path algorithms requires
constraints in complex theories (SAT and LRA). 
Even with recent advances in SMT solving,
approaches that directly generate configurations 
from policies do not scale to 
moderately-sized networks or sets of policies~\cite{synet}. Futhermore,
generating resilient control planes needs reasoning about how
protocols react to failures, which further complicates an
already intractable synthesis problem.

	\label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

In this paper, we present \name, 
that address the aforementioned issues.
Unlike previous approaches, \name uses a two-phased approach for tractability
(\Cref{fig:architecture}) 
that does not attempt to generate 
a policy-compliant control plane in a single step.
First, \name 
uses \genesis~\cite{genesis}
to synthesize paths---i.e., the network forwarding state---that are compliant
with given policies, such as, waypoints and isolation.
\name then generates 
intra-domain (shortest-path OSPF) and inter-domain (BGP) router configurations
that induce the forwarding
state synthesized by \genesis\ {\em and} provide high resilience. 

We investigate three different settings with different policies and
resilience requirements and show how \name, using its two-phase
approach, can effectively generate highly-resilient and
policy-compliant solutions.

First, we consider a setting in which the operator of a hierarchically
structured network wants to enforce a large diverse set of complex
policies (waypoint traversal, isolation, traffic engineering, etc).
The operator also requires a simple notion of
\emph{connectivity-resilience} to guarantee that, under most common
link failures, packets can still reach their destination.
\name synthesizes OSPF configurations using linear constraint solving to compute
link weights and uses the unsatisfiable cores
of failed solving attempts to judiciously place static routes.
\name synthesizes BGP configurations directly 
from the domain mapping (i.e., which router belongs to what domain) and the paths.
Using these techniques, \name can generate configurations that are
$10\%$ more resilient than configurations that only use static routes.

Second, we consider a setting in which the operator 
wants to guarantee that, for common
link failures, the resulting configuration is policy-compliant.
We call this notion \emph{policy-resilience}.  Given the complexity of
this problem, we focus on a {\rm restricted class} of policies.  In
particular, for each class of packets, we allow the operator to
specify a set of waypoints that packets must traverse before reaching their
destination. 
We modify our linear constraints to guarantee that at least two paths
that traverse the waypoints have path cost (e.g., OSPF path cost)
lower than any path not going through a waypoint, thus providing
1-resilience under failure. Using this improved
technique, \name can generate configurations that are $140\%$ more
policy-resilient than configurations generated with our first
technique.

Finally, we consider a setting where the operator can 
specify bounds on the number and sizes of domains her
control plane is organized into, and the ability to assign routers to
different domains.  We present a stochastic search technique that
leverages this flexibility to look for ways to assign routers
to different domains so that the synthesized configurations have even
higher resilience.  Through this, \name can further
improve the resilience of the configurations 
by $10\%$. We show that \name can be naturally used to
bound or optimize different configuration metrics like static routes
and BGP configurations' size to improve network manageability. 

Our experiments show that, thanks to its two-phase approach,
\name can synthesize policy-compliant 
configurations for medium size topologies 
in less than 5 minutes and 
policy-resilient configurations in under an hour. 
Notably, \name's performance is 2-3
orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art network
configuration synthesis system SyNET~\cite{synet}, which uses a direct
synthesis 
approach based on SMT. 

\minisection{Contributions} We make the following contributions.
\begin{itemize}	
    \item \name, a framework for
	that enforces policies in ``traditional'' (OSPF and BGP) networks
	by synthesizing highly-resilient router configurations. 		
	\name  uses concrete
	paths to guide the synthesis  
	instead of directly generating policy-compliant
	configurations.

	\item An algorithm for synthesizing policy-compliant
          configurations with few statically assigned routes. This
          algorithm yields configurations with high network
          connectivity even in the presence of link failures
          (\S~\ref{sec:config-synthesis}).

	\item An algorithm for synthesizing policy-compliant 		
		 configurations that is specialized for waypoint policies. 
		 This algorithm yields configurations that have
		 high policy compliance even in the presence of link failures (\S~\ref{sec:ospfwaypoint}). 
	
	\item A stochastic search mechanism for finding 
		partitions of the network into multiple routing domains which
		yield configurations with higher resilience (\S~\ref{sec:synth-dom-ass}).
	
	\item An implementation of \name together with an evaluation
          of its algorithms for different workloads, and comparison with state-of-the-art
          configuration synthesis tool (\S~\ref{sec:evaluation}).
