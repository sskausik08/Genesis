Operators of modern networks
require support for diverse and complex end-to-end policies, such
as, middlebox traversals, isolation, and traffic engineering. While 
Software-defined Networking (SDN) provides centralized 
custom routing functionality
in networks to realize these policies, many networks still deploy ``traditional''
control planes running distributed routing protocols like OSPF and BGP
because these protocols are scalable and robust to failures. 
However, realization of 
policies by distributed control plane configurations 
is manual and error-prone. 
We show that synthesizing policy-compliant highly-resilient  control planes is a
challenging problem and  propose, \name, a
tool for  automatically generating
policy-compliant control planes that also behave well
under small network failures. 
\name differs from existing approaches in that it uses policy-compliant paths to guide the synthesis process instead of directly generating policy-compliant configurations.
We show that \name can
synthesize highly resilient and policy-compliant configurations 
for real topologies with up to 
80 routers.
