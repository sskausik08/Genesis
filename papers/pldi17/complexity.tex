\begin{theorem}
Finding the set of route-filters $R$ of smallest size such
 that there exists OSPF edge weights $W$ for topology $G=(V,E)$ 
 and the resulting configurations forward traffic along the
input paths $P$ under non-failure scenarios is NP-hard.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We prove the above theorem by reducing the \emph{minimum vertex cover} problem
to finding the smallest set of route-filters and OSPF weights 
which forward traffic along the
input paths under non-failure scenarios. 

Given a graph $G_{vc}=(V_{vc},E_{vc})$ and $VC$ denotes the minimum 
vertex cover of the graph $G_{vc}$.
