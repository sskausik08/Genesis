\begin{theorem}
Finding the set of route-filters of smallest size such that there exists OSPF
edge weights and the resulting configurations forward traffic along the
input paths under non-failure scenarios.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We prove the above theorem by reducing the \emph{minimum vertex cover} problem
to finding the smallest set of route-filters and OSPF weights 
which forward traffic along the
input paths under non-failure scenarios.

\end{proof}
