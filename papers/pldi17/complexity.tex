\begin{theorem}
Finding the set of route-filters $R$ of smallest size such
 that there exists OSPF edge weights $W$ for topology $G=(V,E)$ 
 and the resulting configurations forward traffic along the
input paths $P$ under non-failure scenarios is NP-hard.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We show that the minimum vertex cover problem, which is NP-hard 
reduces finding the smallest set of route-filters and OSPF weights 
which forward traffic along the
input paths under non-failure scenarios. 
The latter is also in NP, so after the reduction we 
can conclude that it is also NP-hard.

Let $G = (V,E)$ be an instance of the 
minimum vertex cover problem. A set of
vertices $VC \subseteq V$ is the vertex cover
if $\forall (v_1, v_2) \in E. ~v_1 \in VC \vee v_2 \in VC$. 
\begin{lemma}
	Atleast 1 route-filter is required to find a valid solution to the
	OSPF edge weights for each diamond formed by the input paths.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Proof by contradiction. We can show that any diamond inconsistency 
	cannot be removed if no route-filters are set on the paths.
\end{proof}
