\minisection{Centralized control}
Programming routers for centralized control has been an
active area of research in recent times. RCP~\cite{rcp} uses
BGP as an substitute to OpenFlow to install rules at the 
switches, but must respond to failures and update the 
rules at switches. Fibbing~\cite{fibbing} provides 
centralized control over distributed routing by creating 
fake nodes and fake links to steer the traffic in the 
network through paths that are not the shortest. However, 
these fake advertisements can create forwarding loops in the
network during failures, and the centralized controller 
has to respond to failures (response to failures can precomputed),
thus making the controller a central point of failure. In contrast,
our approach to distributed control plane synthesis can provide
the same expressive power as Fibbing but also
avoids any centralized component by engineering 
the control plane parameters to match the input specifications. 

\minisection{Configuration synthesis} Propane~\cite{propane} 
tackles synthesis of BGP configurations to satisfy network-wide
objectives, however they tackle a narrower space of BGP policies
using algorithms over automata and graphs. ConfigAssure
~\cite{configassure} uses a combination of 
logic programming and SAT solving to synthesize network
configurations. Fortz et. al~\cite{ospf-te} tackle the 
problem of optimizing OSPF weights for performing traffic
engineering, however their work is tailor-made to the 
specific problem of TE and is inextensible to apply 
to custom forwarding behaviors for other kinds of policies.

resiliency, isolation, and bigger topologies}
