Operators of modern networks
require support for diverse and complex end-to-end policies, such
as, middlebox traversals, isolation, and traffic engineering. While 
Software-defined Networking (SDN) provides centralized 
custom routing functionality
in networks to realize these policies, many networks deploy "traditional"
control planes running distributed routing protocols like OSPF and BGP
because they are scalable and robust to failures. However, realization of 
policies by distributed control plane configurations is manual and error-prone,
and as failure handling is distributed, ensuring policy-compliance under failures 
can be challenging. 
We show that synthesizing policy-compliant control planes is a
challenging problem and  propose a two-phase 
architecture to automatically realize 
fault-tolerant control planes from policy specifications. 
The first phase
uses prior work to synthesize paths that satisfy the policies pertaining to the data-plane and 
the second phase synthesizes
a control plane satisfies the policies pertaining to the control plane and produces the paths synthesized in the first phase. 
This last phase combines constraint solving, for determining 
the edge weights to be used for OSPF and BGP routing
and 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to identify a good way to partition the graph into
multiple routing domains.
We evaluate our techniques on real topologies and \loris{todo}
