\section{Synthesising Intra-domain Configurations} \label{sec:synthesis}
In this section, we present an algorithm for 
solving the path-compliance problem for networks
with a single domain---i.e., $|\{\Theata(n) \mid n\in V\}|=1$.


\subsection{From paths to ARCs} \label{sec:phase2}

The second phase of our approach takes as input the set of paths produced by the first phase
and produces an Abstract Representation of the Control Plane (ARC) that realizes the given set of paths.
First, we consider the problem of generating ARCs that
 forward packets based on shortest-paths---e.g., OSPF routing.
Then, we consider more complex forms of ARCs in which 
 additional mechanisms like route-filtering are allowed. 
 
\subsubsection{From paths to simplified ARCs} \label{sec:sarc}
The \emph{Simplified Abstract Representation of the Control Plane} (sARC) is a directed graph comprising ritches as 
vertices and weighted edges corresponding to all links in the
topology. 
This is an ideal control plane supporting classic shortest path routing in which no links can be disabled. 

The problem of synthesizing 
a sARC that realizes an input set of paths reduces to a
variation of the so-called {\em inverse shortest path} problem~\cite{isp}. 
Assume we are given the following inputs: (1) a directed graph $T = (S, L)$ (the network topology), 
(2) a set of endpoints $\Gamma \subseteq S\times S$
describing the sources and destinations of the input paths, and 
(3) a function $P: \Gamma \rightarrow 2^{L^*}$
that assigns to each pair of endpoints $(s,t) \in \Gamma$ 
a set of \emph{acyclic} paths, such that for every path $l_0\cdots l_n\in P(s,t)$,
$l_0=(s,s')$, for some $s'\in S$, and $l_n=(s'',t)$, for some $s''\in S$.\footnote{
We use $L^*$ the denote the set of all finite sequences over $L$.}
The 
\emph{sARC synthesis}
problem is to find rational weights for the edges in $L$ such that 
for each pair of endpoints $(s,t) \in \Gamma$, 
the paths in $P(s,t)$ are \emph{the} shortest paths from $s$ to $t$ 
in the graph. Notice, that there can be multiple shortest
paths of equal cost for multi-path support (e.g., for traffic engineering).

In sARC, packet forwarding is based on destination.
For a destination $d$, we call $\xi_d$ the directed
subgraph of $T$ obtained by only keeping the nodes and edges 
that are traversed by paths with destination $d$.
Since paths are acyclic, $\xi_d$ is a directed acyclic graph.
We use $\Omega=\{d\mid (\_,d)\in\Gamma\}$ to denote the 
set of all destinations and $\Delta=\{\xi_d\mid d\in \Omega\}$ to denote  
the set of all destination DAGs. 

We use  $r_1\rightarrow r_2$ to denote $(r_1,r_2)\in L$ and
$r_1\rightarrow^* r_2$ (resp. $r_1\rightarrow^+ r_2$) to denote 
that $r_2$ is reachable from $r_1$ by crossing zero (resp. one) or more links in $T$.
Similarly, we use $\rightarrow_{\xi_d}$ to denote the same relations in the destination DAGs.


\minisection{Distance equations}
To solve the sARC synthesis problem, we generate a set of linear equations
to find the required edge weights. 
We use $E(r_1, r_2)$ to denote the weight of the edge $(r_1,r_2)\in L$
and 
$D(r_1, r_2)$ to denote the shortest distance from $r_1$ to $r_2$.
We add the equation $D(s,s) = 0$ for every $s\in S$ to denote that the distance
from a node to itself is $0$.
The
following equation guarantees that $D(s,t)$ is not greater than 
the actual shortest distance from $s$ to $t$.
\begin{multline} \label{eq:dist}
\forall s, t, r. (s \rightarrow r \rightarrow^* t).\\
D(s, t) \leq E(s, r) + D(r, t)
\end{multline}

For each destination DAG $\xi_d\in\Delta$, we add equations to ensure 
that the input paths with destination $d$ are indeed the shortest ones.
 If a path
is the shortest path between its endpoints, then every 
subpath of the path has to be the shortest between its endpoints
as well (otherwise the complete path would not be the shortest).

% 		dotted line represents 1 or more edges. 
% 	} \label{fig:disteq}
% \end{figure}
Consider a DAG $\xi_d$ for destination $d$. We define two neighbour
functions: $N_T(s)$ denotes the set of neighbours of ritch $s$ 
in the input graph $T$, and $N_{\xi_d}(s)$ denote the set of
neighbours of ritch $s$ in the destination DAG $\xi_d$. 
Given a destination $d\in \Omega$,
we use the following equations to ensure that, given two nodes $s$ and $t$ in
$\xi_d$, 
the set of paths from $s$ to $t$ in $\xi_d$ are
exactly
\emph{the} shortest paths from $s$ to $t$ in $T$.
Let $s$ and $t$ be two nodes in $\xi_d$ and let  $Paths_{\xi_d}(s,t)$ be the set of paths from $s$ to $t$ in $\xi_d$.
\begin{multline} \label{eq:uniq1}
		\forall l_0\cdots l_n\in Paths_{\xi_d}(s,t).
		\forall n' \in N(s) \setminus N_{\xi_d}(s). \\
		E(s, n') + D(n', t) > \sum_{\mathclap{\substack{l_i=(s_i,t_i)}}} 
		E(s_i, t_i) 
\end{multline}
\begin{multline} \label{eq:uniq2}
		\forall l_0\cdots l_n\in Paths_{\xi_d}(s,t).
		\forall n' \in N_{\xi_d}(s). n' \not\rightarrow^+_{\xi_d} t.  \\
		E(s, n') + D(n', t) > \sum_{\mathclap{\substack{l_i=(s_i,t_i)}}} 
		E(s_i, t_i) 
\end{multline}
\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{multline} \label{eq:uniq3}
		\forall l_0\cdots l_n, l_0'\cdots l_n'\in Paths_{\xi_d}(s,t).\\
		\sum_{\mathclap{\substack{l_i=(s_i,t_i)}}} 
		E(s_i, t_i)  =\sum_{\mathclap{\substack{l_i'=(s_i',t_i')}}} 
		E(s_i', t_i') 
\end{multline}
Equation~\ref{eq:uniq1} guarantees that 
the sum of the weights belonging to a path from $s$ to $t$ in $\xi_d$ is smaller than 
any path that goes to $t$ via a node $n'$ that is a neighbour of $s$ in $T$ but not in $\xi_d$.
Equation~\ref{eq:uniq2} guarantees that
the sum of the weights belonging to a path from $s$ to $t$ in $\xi_d$ is smaller than 
any path that goes to $t$ via a node $n'$ that is a neighbour of $s$ in $\xi_d$ but such that
$t$ is not reachable from $n'$ in $\xi_d$.
Finally, Equation~\ref{eq:uniq3} guarantees that all the paths from $s$ to $t$ in $\xi_d$ have the same weight.
