\section{Introduction}
\minisection{Contributions} We make the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A new framework for policy enforcement in legacy networks
	by synthesizing router configurations from policy-compliant paths.
	\item Complexity results and a learning-based algorithm using
	linear rational arithmetic (LRA) for synthesis
	of OSPF edge weights with route-filters.
	\item A stochastic search using MCMC sampling to find 
	continuous partitions of the network into OSPF domains and BGP as 
	the inter-domain protocol which optimizes the number of
	route-filters and size of configurations. 
\end{itemize}
