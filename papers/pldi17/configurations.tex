\section{Configuration Requirements}
We consider synthesis of inter-domain 
(for lack of a better word) routing 
configurations where each domain uses a 
IGP for intra-domain routing (like 
OSPF) and domains communicate among 
themselves using BGP. 
Routing inside a domain is controlled 
by synthesizing OSPF edge weights and 
route-filters. BGP is a path-vector
protocol and primarily selects routes by 
AS-PATH length. However, we can 
use BGP's powerful path selection metrics 
like local preferences to select 
paths with greater path lengths (local
preference value is considered first in 
path selection with multiple routes).
