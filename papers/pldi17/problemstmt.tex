\section{Problem Statement}
We define the physical switch topology as an directed graph $T=(S, L)$,
where $S$ is the set of switches and $L$ is the set of links. 
We use the neighbour function $N(s) = \{s'\ | \ (s,s') \in L \}$ to denote 
the set of neighbour switches of $s$. 
We use $\Lambda$ to denote the set of destination IP subnets.

\minisection{OSPF}
Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a routing protocol used inside a
domain. Each router receives link state information from other routers
and uses this to create a map of the network. This link state
information consists of link weights, and each router
forwards to the destination along the weighted shortest path 
to the router the destination IP is connected to. Let us
define the OSPF weight function $W: L \rightarrow \rat$ which 
maps edges of the topology to positive rational weights. 

As shown in \Cref{fig:ospfexample}(b), 
we require route-filters
to selectively disable an
edge for a given destination by  blocking advertisements to a
particular destination along a link.
