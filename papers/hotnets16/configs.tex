\section{Generating Configurations}
\aaron{TODO: talk about the task of generating configurations from an \ARC}
Gember-Jacobson et al.~\cite{arc} describe the process 
of generating the \ARC from the device configurations by transforming 
the concrete network protocol parameters to create weighted digraphs. 
Our three-phased architecture to synthesize distributed control planes
from policies produces the \ARC which has to be compiled to 
individual device configurations, which is the inverse of 
the process tackled by Gember-Jacobson et al. ~\kausik{something more?}

For example, suppose the underlying network comprises 
one complete OSPF domain. For this, we can trivially
compile the \ARC to individual device configurations by: (1)
setting the OSPF link weights to the edge weights of the \ARC, and
(2) adding a route-filter or Access Control List (ACL) for the 
route-filters in the ARC. However, the compilation process becomes
complicated if the network consists of multiple OSPF 
domains, and use BGP for intra-domain communication.
