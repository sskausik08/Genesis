\section{Discussion}
In this paper, we presented preliminary work on an
architecture which 
tackles policy enforcement in networks running distributed 
network protocols by synthesizing resilient control planes,
by using data planes as input and an abstract representation
of the control plane as output. Our vision
is to provide the rich functionalities provided by 
software-defined networks to existing 
networks running traditional network
protocols. 

One of the features of SDN important in policy 
enforcement is the ``Default Off'' behavior, i.e.,
a packet not matching any forwarding rule on a switch
is sent to the controller, which 
decides the forwarding path for this class of packet
based on the policies. This feature ensures that the
centralized controller has knowledge about all active 
packet flows, and can ensure that no flow violates 
policy-compliance. However, legacy control planes 
do not possess this ``Default Off'' behavior, as they 
forward only based on destination.
