\section{Conclusion}
Programming a legacy network control plane to satisfy a variety of
connectivity, security, and performance policies is a complex and error-prone
task. We have shown that program synthesis is a promising approach to automate
this process and produce a control plane that is correct by construction.
In particular, we presented an architecture where a network operator provides
a set of policies 
and the system automatically provides a set of device configurations that
leverage the control plane features available on each device to compute
policy-compliant paths, even in the presence of failures.  
We show how the synthesis problem can be made tractable 
 by modeling the control plane using a graph-based 
abstract representation tied to a traditional shortest path algorithm and
by dividing the synthesis procedures into multiple phases. However, we
have only explored how to address a subset of important policies and leverage a
few control plane features available on traditional networking hardware. Our
future work will focus on satisfying a wider range of policies using more
features and into making our system practical for use with real networks.
