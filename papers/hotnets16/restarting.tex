\subsection{Restarting the synthesis process}
One of the drawbacks of dividing the procedure into multiple phases is that
early phases can produce solutions that will not be able to be handled by future phases.
For example, it could be that, given the paths produce by phase 1, there is no way
to produce a resilient ARC. We want to detect when this happens and restart the synthesis procedure
so that a different set of paths is produced
We briefly describe how the synthesis process can be restarted
when one of the three phases fails.

\loris{this can be short and just talks about unsat cores or stuff like that, technically we can
restart from different phases too.}
