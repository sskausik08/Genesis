\subsection*{Abstract}
Operators of modern networks
require support for diverse and complex end-to-end policies, such
as, middlebox traversals, isolation, and traffic engineering. While 
Software-defined Networking (SDN) provides centralized 
custom routing functionality
in networks to realize these policies, many networks deploy "traditional"
control planes running distributed routing protocols like OSPF and BGP
because they are scalable and robust to failures. However, realization of 
policies by distributed control plane configurations is manual and error-prone,
and as failure handling is distributed, ensuring policy-compliance under failures 
can be challenging. We propose a three-phase 
architecture to automatically realize 
fault-tolerant control planes from policy specifications. First, we 
construct the data plane from policies, and use the data plane to 
synthesize a control plane whose paths follow the data plane paths. 
We then transform the control plane to ensure policy-compliance
under failures to produce a fault-tolerant control plane. 
We use a weighted graph-based abstract representation 
of the control plane called \ARC to simplify the synthesis of control 
planes and compile device configurations based on the underlying
network infrastructure requirements. Our paper presents a preliminary 
treatment of the architecture and the challenges in realizing our vision.
