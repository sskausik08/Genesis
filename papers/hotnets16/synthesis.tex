\section{Synthesis}
We first describe the synthesis of {\em pure} ARCs, i.e., 
ARC with weighted edges and no other mechanisms like route-filters.
A pure ARC enforces the policies, and since no filters are used, the
control plane is {\em maximal resilient} (all links can be used 
to reach a destination). 
% Provide insight about route-filters before.

The inputs to the synthesis algorithm are:

\minisection{Network Data Plane}
Since most legacy routing protocols are destination-based,
from an input data plane, we extract the forwarding
DAG (directed acyclic graph) for each destination
as the sink. The DAG will be a directed tree with the
destination as root if the multi-path
functionality is not used. We define $D$ for the 
set of destinations, and $\Delta$ for  
the set of destination DAGs. 
% Write something about changes to the network manager

\minisection{Network Topology}. 
We define the physical network topology $T = (S, L)$
as a directed graph where $S$: set of switches, and 
$L$: set of directional links. 

The output of the synthesis algorithm is a 
pure ARC with positive weights on the directional links,
such that the set of forwarding DAGs $\Delta$ are the 
shortest paths in the ARC. We define $E(sw_1, sw_2)$ as
the edge weight for link $sw_1 \rightarrow sw_2$.
