\minisection{Network Data Plane}
Since most legacy routing protocols are destination-based,
from an input data plane, we extract the forwarding
DAG (directed acyclic graph) for each destination
as the sink. The DAG will be a directed tree with the
destination as root if the multi-path
functionality is not used. We define $\Delta$ to 
the set of destination DAGs.

\minisection{Network Topology}. 
We define the physical network topology $T = (S, L)$
as a directed graph where $S$: set of switches, and 
$L$: set of directional links.
