\begin{theorem}[Correctness with static routes]
	For a OSPF configuration $C$ with edge weights $W$ and
	static routes $SR$, and for a packet class $pc$, source router $s_{pc}$, destination router $d_{pc}$ and destination $\lambda_{pc}$ and the path provided by Genesis $\pi_{pc}$, \Cref{alg:unsat} produces $W$ and $SR$ 
	such that $GP$	is in the set of induced paths of $C$, i.e., $~~\pi_{pc} \in \paths^C(pc)$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let us assume that $\pi_{pc} \not\in \paths^C(pc)$. 
Let us denote the 
Genesis path $\pi_{pc}$ as $(s_{pc}, s_1)$ $ (s_1, s_2) \
\ldots (s_n, d_{pc})$. 

Given the routing function $\route^C$ which depends on $SR$ and
$W$, let the first switch where routing diverges from $GP$ be at $s_p$: 
$s_{p+1} \not\in \route^C(s_{p}, \lambda_{pc})$. Let us consider  $r \in \route^C(s_{p}, \lambda_{pc})$. By virtue of
constraint (\ref{eq:unique}) added to ensure the path from $s_{p}$
to $d_{pc}$ is the unique shortest path: 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:uniq}
\sum_{\mathclap{\substack{(s_{p},s_{p+1})\ldots(s_{n},d_{pc})}}} 
W(s_i, s_j) < W(s_{p}, r) + D(r, d_{pc})
\end{equation}

\Cref{alg:unsat} uses unsatisfiable cores to greedily remove 
constraints and find a solution for $W$ and $SR$. Note that 
the algorithm only removes the shortest unique path 
constraints (\ref{eq:unique}) and 
not the distance constraints (\ref{eq:distance}).
\paragraph{Case 1:} Constraint (\ref{eq:uniq}) is not removed by 
\Cref{alg:unsat}. Thus, there is no static route $(s_p, s_{p+1})$ for
$\lambda_{pc}$, and OSPF-based forwarding occurs at $s_{p}$. 
For any path $(r, r_1), (r_1, r_2) \ldots (r_m, d_{pc})$, 
using the distance constraints (\ref{eq:distance}) to
expand $D(r, d_{pc})$, we get the following: 
\[
\sum_{\mathclap{\substack{(s_{p},s_{p+1})\ldots(s_{n},d_{pc})}}} 
W(s_i, s_j) < W(s_{p}, r) + W(r, r_{1}) + D(r_{1}, d_{pc})
\]
\begin{center}
	$\ldots$
\end{center}
\[
\sum_{\mathclap{\substack{(s_{p},s_{p+1})\ldots(s_{n},d_{pc})}}} 
W(s_i, s_j) < W(s_{p}, r) + W(r, r_{1}) + \ldots W(r_{m}, d_{pc}) + D(d_{pc}, d_{pc})
\]
Therefore, the weight of any path through $r$ is greater than 
the path through $s_{p}$. However, 
OSPF sends traffic through the shortest weighted
path, therefore, $r \not\in R^C_{ospf}(s_p, \lambda_{pc})$. Hence, 
$s_{p+1} \in \route^C(s_{p}, \lambda_{pc})$.

\paragraph{Case 2:} Constraint (\ref{eq:uniq}) is removed by 
\Cref{alg:unsat} and therefore, $SR(s_p, \lambda_{pc}) = \{s_{p+1}\}$. 
Thus, $s_{p+1} \in \route^C(s_{p}, \lambda_{pc})$ as static routes 
have the higher priority than OSPF. This contradicts our assumption
that $s_{p+1} \not\in \route^C(s_{p}, \lambda_{pc})$. 

Hence, proved by contradiction, $\pi_{pc} \in \paths^C(pc)$.
