\section{From Policies to Connectivity-Resilient  Configurations}
\label{sec:config-synthesis}

We now present an algorithm
for synthesizing distributed configurations
that adhere to path policies like the one described 
in Figure~\ref{tab:policysupport}.
In general, no existing tool for synthesizing 
distributed configurations
can handle this heterogeneous set of 
these policies---e.g., isolation---and, even less so,
generate resilient configurations.
Due to the complexity of the problem, we focus on 
synthesizing  configurations that 
are \emph{policy-compliant} and have high \emph{connectivity-resilience}.



\subsection{A two-phase approach}
Existing approaches to configuration synthesis
try to directly generate configurations from the given policies~\cite{synet},
but a direct approach leads to scalability issues as well as limitation
in the set of supported policies.
Instead of directly generating configurations from policies, 
\name proceeds in two-steps:
first it generates policy-compliant paths
and then it synthesizes distributed configurations that realize these paths
and have high connectivity resilience.

Since we showed how to generate policy-compliant paths in Section~\ref{sec:genesis},
we are left with solving a path-compliance problem.
Formally, we are given a set of paths $\Pi$,
a topology $T=(V,L)$,
a domain-assignment function $\Theta$, 
%and configuration policies $P$,
and we want to find functions of the configuration
$C=(\Theta,W,LP,IF,SR)$ such that
$\paths^C(PC) = \Pi$.
%., and
%$C$ satisfies $P$.
%Ideally, we want to directly generate configurations that maximize 
%connectivity resilience, but already generating policy-compliant configuration is
%a hard problem.
This problem admits a trivial solution that 
enforces the set of input paths
 by adding a 
static route to $SR(\lambda)$ for every link $l$ in 
set of the paths $\Pi$. 
However, this solution uses more static routes than necessary
and, in the presence of failures, static routes may
create routing loops that make certain connections 
unreachable, hence reducing connectivity-resilience.
Given the relation between the number of static 
routes and connectivity-resilience,
we set as our goal that of generating configurations 
with few static routes.

In the following sections, we assume we are given paths that are compliant to 
all path policies and we only need to find configurations that realize those paths.
Therefore, the algorithms we present solve the path-compliance synthesis problem
and whenever we discuss soundness and completeness is with respect to such a problem.
In general, for a given set of paths, we might not be able to find a path-compliant configuration
that satisfies all the required configuration policies. However, in this case
we can simply use the techniques from Section~\ref{sec:genesis} to generate
a new set of paths.
Assuming we have a sound and complete algorithm for the
path-compliance synthesis problem, we can obtain a sound and complete algorithm
for the
 configuration synthesis problem by keeping enumerating more policy compliant paths
 whenever the path-compliance synthesis fails.

We show how to synthesize 
path-compliant intra-domain 
configurations---i.e., when there
is only a single domain---and then extend our technique to
 inter-domain configurations---i.e., when
there are multiple domains.



\subsection{Synthesising Path-compliant Intra-domain Configurations} \label{sec:intra-synthesis}
In this section, we show how to synthesize  path-compliant  intra-domain configurations that
use few static routes.
To justify the complexity of the techniques 
we are going to present,
we show that
%, even when policy-compliant paths are provided, 
obtaining configurations with minimal numbers of static routes is a 
computationally hard problem.
\begin{theorem}[Hardness of synthesis]
\label{thm:ospfsynth}
Given a
network with a single domain,
and a positive number $C_{sc}$,
the problem of generating
a path-compliant configuration with at most $C_{sc}$ static routes
is NP-complete.
\end{theorem}
\iffull
\input{route-filters-nphard}
%\else
%The reduction is from the vertex cover problem.
\fi
Since the problem of optimally placing 
static routes is computationally hard, 
%(Theorem~\ref{thm:ospfsynth}), 
we propose a non-optimal greedy strategy.
We first show how to solve the problem when 
there exists a solution with no static routes
and then extend our technique to greedily 
add static routes when needed. We use 
efficient off-the-shelf linear programming (LP) 
solvers for solving the system of constraints 
which are presented in the following sections. 
			
\subsubsection{Intra-domain Synthesis without Static Routes} \label{sec:ospf}
 
In the absence of static routes,
 OSPF routers use edge weights
 to choose the
 shortest weighted path for each pair of endpoints. 
Our goal is to synthesize the weight function $W$.
Consider the \Cref{fig:edgeweightexample} example, 
if $\Pi$ contains the 
 path $\pi=s\rightarrow r_1 \rightarrow t$ for
 destination IP $\lambda$, \name assigns
 edge weights so that $\pi$ has
 smaller weight than the path $\pi'=s \rightarrow t$ ---e.g., $W(\pi)=3$
  and $W(\pi')=5$.

	}
	\vspace{-3mm}
	\compactcaption{OSPF edge weights
		such that the routers forward traffic along
		the colored path.}
	\label{fig:edgeweightexample}
\end{wrapfigure}
The problem of synthesizing the weight function $W$ that
realizes an input set of paths $\Pi$ is
a
variation of the so-called {\em inverse shortest path} 
problem~\cite{isp}. 
For a destination IP $\lambda$, we call $\xi_\lambda$ 
the directed tree of $T$ 
obtained by only keeping the nodes and edges 
that are traversed by paths in $\Pi$ for 
$\lambda$; the root of the tree
is the destination router connected to $\lambda$. 
 This destination tree
 property is due to the modifications to \genesis
 to support OSPF's destination-based forwarding. We
 define $\Delta=\{\xi_\lambda\mid \lambda \in \Lambda\}$ to be 
the set of all destination trees. 

Given a set of input paths $\Pi$, \name 
generates a set of linear constraints to 
find weights 
for each $(r_1, r_2) \in L$.
The constraints use the variable $W(r_1, r_2)$
to denote the weight of the edge $(r_1, r_2)$, and the variable
$D(r_1, r_2)$ to denote the 
shortest distance from $r_1$ to $r_2$.
We add the equation $D(s, s) = 0$
for every $s\in S$, to denote that the distance
from a node to itself is $0$.
\Cref{eq:distance} guarantees that $D(s,t)$ is smaller or equal to
the shortest distance from $s$ to $t$.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:distance}
\forall s, t. ~\forall r \in N(s).~
D(s,t) \leq W(s,r) + D(r,t)
\end{equation}
Intuitively, the shortest path connecting $s$ to $t$
must traverse through one of the neighbor routers of $s$,
and thus, distance can be defined inductively as the 
shortest among distances from the neighbors. 

For each destination tree $\xi_\lambda\in\Delta$, we add equations to ensure 
that the input paths with destination $\lambda$ are the shortest ones.
Notice that, if a path $\pi$
is the shortest path between its endpoints, every 
subpath of $\pi$ also has to be the shortest path between its endpoints.
For each tree $\xi_\lambda$, we define the neighbour
 $N_{\xi_\lambda}(s)$ to denote the 
next-hop neighbour of router $s$ in the destination tree $\xi_\lambda$---i.e., the parent
of $s$ in the tree or no node if $s$ is the root of the tree. We denote the
router directly connected to $\lambda$ (the root of the tree $\xi_\lambda$) by $R_\lambda$.

For a path $\pi$, 
$\sum_{\pi} W$ denotes the sum of weights of all 
links in $\pi$. 
The following equation ensures that, for any node $s$ in 
$\xi_\lambda$, 
the path $(s,r_1)\cdots (r_n,R_\lambda)$ from $s$ to $R_\lambda$ 
in $\xi_\lambda$ is the 
\emph{unique shortest path}\footnote{
If two paths have the same weight, then OSPF will 
split the traffic among the two paths.
} from $s$ to $R_\lambda$ in $T$. 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:unique}
\forall s \in \xi_\lambda. ~
\forall r \in N(s) \setminus N_{\xi_\lambda}(s).~~
\sum_{\mathclap{\substack{(s,r_1)\cdots (r_n,R_\lambda)}}} 
W < W(s,r) + D(r, R_\lambda)
\end{equation}
\Cref{eq:unique} guarantees that 
the sum of the weights belonging to the path 
from $s$ to $R_\lambda$ in $\xi_\lambda$ 
is strictly smaller than 
any path that goes to $R_\lambda$ via 
a node $n'$ that is a neighbour of $s$ in $T$ but not 
the next-hop in $\xi_\lambda$. Note that,
while $D(r, R_\lambda)$ can be smaller 
than the actual shortest
distance from $r$ to $R_\lambda$, 
$D(r, R_\lambda)$ is used to upper bound the sum of edge weights 
in $\xi_\lambda$, and  
thus, the solution to the edge weights will ensure 
paths in $\xi_\lambda$ are the shortest. 

\begin{theorem}[OSPF Soundness]
%For a OSPF configuration $C$ with edge weights $W$ and no 
%static routes, and for a packet class $pc$, source router $s_{pc}$, destination router $d_{pc}$ and destination $\lambda_{pc}$ and the path provided by Genesis $\pi_{pc}$, if $W$ satisfy constraints \cref{equations}, then $\pi_{pc}$ 
%is in the set of induced paths of $C$, i.e., $~~\pi_{pc} \in \paths^C(pc)$
For a set of paths $\Pi$, if edge weights 
$W$ satisfy constraints (\ref{eq:distance}) and (\ref{eq:unique}), then 
each path $\pi \in \Pi$ is the unique shortest path between its endpoints. 
\end{theorem}
\iffull
\begin{proof}
	Let us assume there exists a path $\pi
	= (s, s_1)(s_1, s_2) 
	\ldots (s_n, d)$ in $\Pi$ such that $\pi$ is \emph{not} the unique 
	shortest path between $s$ and $d$. Let  $\sigma = (s, r_1)(r_1, r_2)\ldots (r_m,
	 d)$ be one of the shortest path that is different from $\pi$. 	
	\noindent Since, $\sigma$ is the shortest weighted path: 
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:assumption}
	\sum_{\pi} W \geq \sum_{\sigma} W
	\end{equation}
	
	Let $s_i \not= r_i$ be the first point of divergence of the paths---i.e., for every $j<i$, $s_{j} = r_{j}$.
    Constraints (\ref{eq:unique}) 
	impose $(s_{i-1}, s_i)\ldots(s_n, d)$ to be the
	unique shortest path by ensuring the edge weights of the path
	are smaller than any path going through a neighbouring 
	router other than $s_i$. 
	Consider the 
	neighbour router $r_i$ in $\sigma$:
	\[
	\sum_{\mathclap{\substack{(s_{i-1}, s_i)\cdots(s_n, d)}}} 
	W < W(s_{i-1}, r_i)+ D(r_i, d)
	\]
	We can then use constraint (\ref{eq:distance}) to expand the term $D(r_k, d)$ for $i \leq k \leq m$
	and obtain the following: 
	\[
	\sum_{\mathclap{\substack{(s_{i-1}, s_i)\cdots(s_n, d)}}} 
	W < W(s_{i-1}, r_i)+ W(r_i, r_{i+1}) + D(r_{i+1}, d)
	\] 
	\begin{center}
		$\ldots$
	\end{center}
	\[
	\sum_{\mathclap{\substack{(s_{i-1}, s_i)\cdots(s_n, d)}}} 
	W < W(s_{i-1}, r_i)+ W(r_i, r_{i+1}) + \ldots W(r_{m}, d) + D(d, d)
	\] 
	\[
	\sum_{\mathclap{\substack{(s_{i-1}, s_i)\cdots(s_n, d)}}} 
	W \hspace{0.4cm}< \hspace{0.4cm}
	\sum_{\mathclap{\substack{(r_{i-1}, r_i)\cdots(r_m, d)}}} 
	W
	\]
	Adding $\Sigma_{(s, s_1)\cdots(s_{i-2},s_{i-1})}W$ to both sides:
	\[
	\sum_{\mathclap{\substack{\pi}}} 
	W < 
	\sum_{\mathclap{\substack{\sigma}}} 
	W
	\] 
	This contradicts assumption (\ref{eq:assumption}) that 
	$\sigma$ is one of the shortest paths from $s$ to $d$. 
	Hence, proved, all paths in $\Pi$ are the unique shortest paths if $W$
	satisfy constraints (\ref{eq:distance}) and (\ref{eq:unique}).
\end{proof}
\fi

OSPF synthesis is complete as well---i.e., a solution for the OSPF weights
such that all paths in $\Pi$ are the unique shortest paths, will satisfy constraints 
(\ref{eq:distance}) and (\ref{eq:unique}).
\begin{theorem}[Completeness]
For a set of paths $\Pi$ and edge weights $W$,
if every path $\pi \in \Pi$ is the unique shortest path between its endpoints. 
then
$W$ satisfies constraints (\ref{eq:distance}) and (\ref{eq:unique}).

\subsubsection{Intra-domain Synthesis with Static Routes} \label{sec:ospfsr}

If the system of equations presented in Section~\ref{sec:ospf} admits a solution, 
the values of the $W(s,t)$ variables are the weights we are trying to synthesize,
otherwise the intra-domain synthesis problem 
cannot be solved without static routes.

\end{wrapfigure}
Consider the example in \Cref{fig:srexample}
where the two paths between $s$ and $t$ are used by 
destinations $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$. This
set of input paths does not admit a solution. 
The following is required for $\lambda_1$: 
$W(s \rightarrow r_1 \rightarrow t) < W(s \rightarrow t)$, 
and vice-versa for $\lambda_2$. 
To steer the traffic for a particular destination
to a next-hop router not on the OSPF shortest path, we can 
install a static route. For example, if we install
a static route at router $s$ to forward $\lambda_2$ 
traffic to router $t$, this route will have a higher
preference compared to the OSPF route
through $r_1$~\cite{admindistance}.
%Since there are no static routes for
%$\lambda_1$, the traffic to $\lambda_1$ will be forwarded to $t$
%through $r_1$ using the OSPF shortest path.



Since the problem of minimizing the number of static routes
is NP-complete, we opt to place static routes using a best-effort approach.
Our algorithm starts by trying to synthesize a solution
that does not use static routes using the equations 
proposed in \secref{sec:ospf}. 
In the case of a failure, the algorithm uses the ``proof of unsatisfiability''---i.e., the unsatisfiable core---generated by 
the constraint solver 
to greedily add a small set of static routes. 
Certain equations are eliminated 
to model the added static routes 
and the approach is repeated until a solution is found.
%We now propose a
%technique for choosing the static routes based 
%on the unsatisfiable core. 

%\kausik{Equations with static routes:
%%\loris{why do we need to modify \eqref{eq:dist}? Can't we just add $D_s^t(d)\geq D_s^t$ for
%%all $d$}
%We assume we are given a route-filter function $RF$ and 
%use $s\rightarrow_d^* t$ to denote that $s$ can reach $t$
%without using any edge in $RF(d)$.
%We use the variable $D_{r_1}^{r_2}(d)$ to denote the shortest distance from $r_1$ to $r_2$
%using only edges that are not filtered for destination $d$.
%We can revise equation \eqref{eq:dist}   to restrict the values of 
%each variable $D_{r_1}^{r_2}(d)$
%by  ignoring all the filtered edges---i.e., only consider a switch $r\in N(s)$ if
%$(s,r)$ is not in $RF(d)$. 
%In summary, we need to add one modified version of equation \eqref{eq:dist} 
%and equation  \eqref{eq:unique} for each destination $d$.
%If the encoding without route filters produces $n$ equations, this
%encoding produces $kn$ equations where $k$ is the total number of destinations.  
%To mitigate this problem, we observe that the shortest distance $D_s^t(d)$ between two
%nodes $s$ and $t$ without using edges filtered for $d$ is
%greater or equal to the distance $D_s^t$ obtained without route filters.  
%We use this property to simplify the
%encoding by only computing $D_s^t$ and by replacing each instance of
%$D_s^t(d)$ with $D_s^t$ in the equations.  It is easy to see that 
%if the set of constraints with variables $D_s^t(d)$ admits a solution,
%the corresponding set of constraints with variables $D_s^t$ 
%also admits a solution (because $D_s^t\leq
%D_s^t(d)$).  However, the reverse is not true and the set of
%simplified equations can be unsatisfiable in cases in which the
%original set is satisfiable, causing addition of unnecessary filters.
%Since our algorithm is already greedy and it does not try to compute the optimal 
%number of route filters, this is not a problem.}

%\minisection{Adding static routes using unsatisfiable cores}
To choose what static route to place, we use
LP-solvers' ability to produce an
unsatisfiable core, also called IIS (Irreducible Inconsistent Subsystem)~\cite{chinneck2007feasibility}. 
Intuitively, an IIS is a subset of the input constraints such that,
if all constraints except those in the IIS are removed, the resulting set of
linear equations is still unsatisfiable. Moreover, the set is irreducible---i.e., removing 
any one constraint from the IIS produces a satisfiable set of constraints. 
In our case, an IIS cannot consist of only 
constraints from \Cref{eq:distance} as these constraints
admit a trivial solution with all variables set to 0. 
Therefore, an IIS must contain some constraint of the form
given in Equations~(\ref{eq:unique})
that was added in to reason about a destination tree $\xi_\lambda$
at router $s$. Let us denote 
this set of constraints as $\Psi_U(s, \lambda)$:
\[
[\sum_{\mathclap{\substack{l_i=(r_1,r_2)}}} 
W(r_1, r_2) < W(s, r) + D(r, R_\lambda) ] \in \Psi_U(s, \lambda)
\]	
This constraint is added to ensure 
that router $s$ forwards to traffic to next-hop
$N_{\xi_\lambda}(s)$ and not some neighbor router 
$r$, based on OSPF weights,
but the path through $r$ is causing the unsatisfiability. 
To remove this inequality from the set of constraints, 
we add the static route $(s,N_{\xi_\lambda}(s))$ to $SR(\lambda)$.
As a result of adding of static route, \name removes 
the $\Psi_U(s, \lambda)$ constraints as router $s$ 
will forward $\lambda$ traffic  to 
next-hop $N_{\xi_\lambda}(s)$ irrespective of
the OSPF distances to the destination; the 
unsatisfiability caused by this IIS is eliminated. 
However, the new set of
constraints may still be unsatisfiable due to other IISes.
We repeat the procedure and add static routes
until we obtain a satisfiable set of
constraints. 
In each iteration, there can be more than one way to place a static route and
\name picks one randomly. ~\Cref{alg:unsat} illustrates
this unsat-core based approach of finding the static routes and edge weights.
