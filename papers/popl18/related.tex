\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related}
\paragraph{Centralized control} Programming routers for centralized
control has been an active area of research in recent times. One of
the first systems, RCP~\cite{rcp}, supported logically central BGP
configuration. The more recent Fibbing~\cite{fibbing} system provides
centralized control over distributed routing by creating fake nodes
and fake links to steer the traffic in the network through paths that
are not the shortest, similar to how \name uses static routes.  Both
approaches face the issue of forwarding loops in the network during
failures. Fibbing and \name differ in the specific algorithms to solve
the synthesis problem.  \name does offer key advantages: first, by
using static routes for steering, we do not increase the traffic in
the network, unlike the fake advertisements used in Fibbing. Second,
Fibbing by design targets a single domain and does not take into account
domain decomposition and inter-domain routing. 

%However, these fake advertisements can create
%forwarding loops in the network during failures, and the centralized
%controller has to respond to failures (response to failures can
%precomputed), thus making the controller a central point of
%failure. In contrast, our approach to distributed control plane
%synthesis can provide the same expressive power as Fibbing but avoids
%any centralized component by engineering the control plane parameters
%to match the input specifications.  


\paragraph{Configuration synthesis} 
ConfigAssure~\cite{configassure}
uses a combination of logic programming and SAT solving to synthesize
network configurations for security, 
functionality, performance and
reliability requirements specified as constraints; 
but it does not
support any notion of policy- or connectivity-resilience 
or hierarchical domain splitting.  Fortz
et. al~\cite{ospf-te} tackle the problem of optimizing OSPF weights
for performing traffic engineering, but their work is tailor-made
to just this specific problem.

Propane~\cite{propane, propaneat} tackles the specific problem of
synthesizing BGP configurations for concrete and abstract topologies
to ensure network-wide objectives hold even under failures. The policy
language of Propane is suited to specify preferences on paths and
peering policies among different autonomous systems. Propane
translates policies to a graph-based intermediate representation,
which is then compiled to device-level BGP configurations. It is
unclear how to extend Propane to incorporate domains, configuration
complexity, or OSPF routing.

SyNET~\cite{synet} tackles network-wide configuration synthesis
(Definition \ref{def:policycompliance}) in an elegant manner by
modeling the behavior and interactions of the routing protocols as a
stratified Datalog program, and using SMT to synthesize the Datalog
input such that the fixed point of the Datalog program (which
represents the network's forwarding state after the protocols have
converged) satisfies certain policies or path requirements.  While
both systems can take paths as input requirements, \name uses
a two-phase approach where OSPF weights are synthesized
separately using
LP-solvers---which are faster and parallelizable---rather than directly  
solving the whole configuration synthesis problem using SMT solvers.  
Moreover, SyNET's approach
does not deal with resilience, a key aspect we tackle in this paper,
and
SyNET does not attempt to minimize the number of static routes,
which can cause undesirable behaviors like routing loops.  Finally,
SyNET supports routers that run both OSPF and BGP protocols and can be
configured with static routes, which does not fit naturally into a
hierarchical structure where some routers only run OSPF and not
BGP. In contrast, our MCMC algorithm can look for dynamic domain
assignments.

\paragraph{Policy languages} While \name uses \genesis 
to synthesize policy-compliant paths, in the future it could use
other policy language frameworks as a front-end
too; existing frameworks offer perhaps less rich policy support but better
performance. %% Other works on
%% centralized policy enforcement for SDN are Merlin~\cite{merlin} and
%% NetKAT~\cite{netkat}.
In Merlin~\cite{merlin}, data planes that adhere to policies expressed
using regular expressions are synthesized by first intersecting the
topology with the regular expressions appearing in the policies and
then encoding reachability in the intersected graph using mixed
integer linear programming (ILP).  Merlin supports min and max
bandwidth guarantees.

NetKAT~\cite{netkat} is a domain-specific language and logic for 
specifying and verifying network packet-processing functions
for SDN, based on Kleene algebra with tests (KAT). Semantically,
a NetKAT predicate and policy is a function that takes a packet
history and produces a set of (possibly empty) packet histories. 
NetKAT can be used to express certain network-wide policies like 
reachability, waypoints using regular expressions for describing the paths, 
and programs on virtual topologies; it uses
BDDs and symbolic automata to translate global programs to local
switch programs~\cite{netkatcompiler}.
Both Merlin and NetKAT  do not support link-isolation 
to produce edge-disjoint paths, which is needed for  
our waypoint-compliance algorithm presented in Section~\ref{sec:waypointres}.
As future work, we will consider 
how to apply these other front-ends to \name.

%% However, the NetKAT semantics
%% cannot be used to express policies based on hyperproperties
%% ~\cite{hyperproperties}, i.e., 
%% the packet processing function requires multiple packet histories
%% as input. Traffic engineering or isolated paths are policies
%% based on hyperproperties.

%% While Genesis supports richer policies, its SMT-based approach is slower in synthesis. As part of future work, we will consider how

%Fine-grained traffic engineering based on online demand/flow size estimation and 
%rapid rerouting is also crucial for datacenter workloads, and extending \name's
%TE policies to fine-grained timescales is subject of future work.
%Also, the performance
%of SMT solvers with optimization objectives is quite slow, and calls for 
%domain-specific techniques to speed up the synthesis. Also, datacenter
%networks are highly symmetrical, and this symmetry can be leveraged
%to speed up synthesis (similar to the work of Plotkin et. al~\cite{symmetry} to
%speed up network verification using symmetry). The main challenges of
%using symmetry in synthesis is considering two aspects of symmetry: network
%symmetry and policy symmetry. Also, our treatment of resilience synthesis
%is preliminary and future work will be geared towards synthesizing resilient
%forwarding planes incorporating capacity constraints and traffic engineering.
