\section{Introduction}

Programming networks to correctly forward flows according to user- and
application-induced policies is difficult and
error-prone~\cite{troubleshooting, bgpmisconfig}. 
At least three
common characteristics of network policies are to blame: (1) A network
may need to satisfy several types of policies, including reachability
(i.e., which endpoints can communicate), isolation (i.e., which flows
cannot share links), service chaining (i.e., which ``middleboxes'',
e.g., firewalls or load balancers, must be traversed), resilience
(e.g., number of available backup paths), and traffic engineering
(e.g., minimizing average link utilization). (2) The network must
provide certain guarantees in the event of failures. Ideally, every
set of forwarding paths (i.e., data plane) installed in the network
%---either manually or by a control plane---
should conform to these policies, otherwise performance, security, or
availability problems may arise. (3) Most policies are global---i.e.,
they concern end-to-end paths, not individual devices/links.

The global nature of network policies is one motivation for
software-defined networking (SDN). SDN allows paths to be centrally
computed over a global view of the network. However, ensuring paths
are correctly computed and installed in the presence of failures is
difficult in practice, even if the SDN controller is
distributed~\cite{hasdn}.  Traditional control planes rely on
distributed protocols such as Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to compute paths; these protocols
typically employ variants of least cost path computation, and react to
failures by recomputing least cost paths and installing forwarding
state in routers that induces the paths. In contrast to centralized
SDN, traditional control planes offer greater fault tolerance; but,
determining the appropriate distributed realization of policies is
hard~\cite{propane}.

Our high-level goal is to develop a system to {\em automate the
  process of creating a correct and failure-resilient distributed
  realization of policies in a traditional control plane}. To be
useful, such a system must satisfy a few key requirements. First, it
must handle a wide range of commonly-used policies---including
reachability, service chaining, and traffic engineering---to meet
applications' diverse security and compliance requirements. Second, it
must ensure that configurations are resilient to network malfunctions
such as link failures. Third, with increasing sizes of networks, it
must provide support for realizing hierarchical control planes---
where a network is split into several ``domains'' atop which a
hierarchy of control plane configurations is deployed---to ensure
scalability. This necessitates the use of multiple intra- and
inter-domain routing protocols (e.g., OSPF and BGP). Finally, to
improve manageability and network
cost-effectiveness~\cite{mpa:imc15,complexity:sigcomm11}, it must
ensure that configurations obey certain general
rules-of-thumb~\cite{complexity:nsdi09}, e.g., limiting the number of
lines of configurations and the use of certain configuration
constructs.


Thus, our work contrasts with prior efforts~\cite{netegg, propane,
  merlin, simple, fattire, netkat, netkatcompiler, sol}, which suffer
from one or more of these issues: they generate SDN- or BGP-specific
control planes for a limited range of policies (e.g., peering); do not
attempt to be resilient to failures; do not support generating
hierarchical control planes; and do not enable generation of
simple-to-manage network configurations. 

The problem of synthesizing router configurations for which the
distributed control plane is resilient to failures and generates
policy-compliant paths is computationally hard.  First, even
generating a set of policy-compliant paths for an SDN is
computationally hard---e.g., enforcing isolated paths is NP-complete.
Second, to infer the concrete set of paths induced by network
configurations, one has to incorporate into synthesis complex
concepts---e.g., reasoning about shortest path algorithms requires
constraints in complex theories that combine propositional logic (SAT)
with linear rational arithmetic (LRA). Even with recent advances in
Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers, approaches that directly
generate configurations from policies do not scale to even
moderately-sized networks or sets of policies~\cite{synet}.  Third, to
generate resilient control planes one has to reason about how
different protocols react to failures, which further complicates an
already intractable synthesis problem.

\end{wrapfigure}

In this paper, we present \name, a new system for synthesizing
highly resilient policy-compliant configurations.
Unlike previous approaches, \name uses a two-phased approach for tractability
(\Cref{fig:architecture}) 
that does not attempt to generate 
a policy-compliant control plane in a single step.
First, \name 
uses \genesis~\cite{genesis}
to synthesize paths---i.e., the network forwarding state---that are compliant
with given policies, such as, waypoints and isolation.
\name then generates 
intra-domain (shortest-path OSPF) and inter-domain (BGP) router configurations
that induce the forwarding
state synthesized by \genesis\ {\em and} provide high resilience. 
%We consider hierarchical networks  routers run
%OSPF for intra-domain routing, while domains use BGP for inter-domain
%routing. Moreover, routers can install static routes---i.e., default routes that can bypass the other two protocols.

We investigate three different settings with different policies and
resilience requirements and show how \name, using its two-phase
approach, can effectively generate highly-resilient and
policy-compliant solutions.

First, we consider a setting in which the operator of a hierarchically
structured network wants to enforce a large diverse set of complex
policies (waypoint traversal, isolation, traffic engineering, etc).
The operator also requires a simple notion of
\emph{connectivity-resilience} to guarantee that, under most common
link failures, packets can still reach their destination.
%In general, in the absence of static routes a network can support
%a number of link failures equal to the min-cut of the network, regardless
%of the OSPF and BGP configurations.
%However, we might need static routes to generate policy-compliant configurations.
%Static routes can cause unexpected network behaviors after a failure---e.g., a forwarding loop---and
%we argue that the \emph{connectivity-resilience} of a configuration is related to the its number of static routes.
To increase connectivity-resilience, \name tries to produce
policy-compliant configurations with a small number of {\em static
  routes}---i.e., static router configurations where routers have
fixed next hops for a destination that bypass routes computed by routing protocols (OSPF and BGP).
%---helps 
%increasing \emph{connectivity-resilience} and
%decreasing configuration complexity. 
%thus, easing automated
%verification~\cite{batfish, arc, era} and improving readability for
%performing future manual changes.
%Therefore, \name aims at producing policy-compliant configurations with a small number of static routes.
To do so, \name synthesizes OSPF configurations using linear constraint solving to compute
link weights and uses the unsatisfiable cores
of failed solving attempts to learn when to introduce static routes.
\name synthesizes BGP configurations directly from the domain mapping (i.e., which router belongs to what domain) and the paths.
Using these techniques, \name can generate configurations that are
$11\%$ more resilient than configurations that only use static routes.

Second, we consider a setting in which the operator wants to enforce a
set of policies and wants to guarantee that, for most of the common
link failures, the resulting configuration is still policy-compliant.
We call this notion \emph{policy-resilience}.  Given the complexity of
this problem, we focus on a {\rm restricted class} of policies.  In
particular, for each class of packets, we allow the operator to
specify a set of waypoints---e.g., firewalls and traffic
scrubbers---that packets must traverse before reaching their
destination.  To generate configurations with high policy-resilience,
we modify our linear constraints to guarantee that at least two paths
that traverse the waypoints have path cost (e.g., OSPF path cost)
lower than any path not going through a waypoint.  Using this improved
technique, \name can generate configurations that are $140\%$ more
policy-resilient than configurations generated with our first
technique.

Finally, we consider a setting in which the operator has the
flexibility to specify bounds on the number and sizes of domains her
control plane is organized into, and the ability to assign routers to
different domains.  We present a stochastic search technique that
actually leverages this flexibility to look for ways to assign routers
to different domains so that the synthesized configurations have even
higher resilience.  Using this search technique, \name can further
improve the resilience of the configurations generated by the previous
two techniques by $10\%$. We show that \name can be naturally used to
bound or optimize different configuration metrics like static routes
and BGP configurations' size to improve network manageability. \aditya{check this}

Our experiments show that 
\name can synthesize policy-compliant 
congurations for medium size topologies 
in less than 5 minutes and 
policy-resilient congurations in under an hour. 
Notably, \name's performance is 2-3
orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art network
configuration synthesis system Synet~\cite{synet}. 



%We evaluate \name on medium-sized topologies and show that
%\name can synthesize OSPF configurations for 200 paths in 200
%seconds for a 40 node ISP topology, and achieve greater than 
%50\% resilience for fat-tree topologies.
%\todo{what does resilient mean here? this last para and contrib need to be rewritten
%after eval}
% On average, using MCMC, \name can increase
%endpoint resilience by $1.6\times$ and 
%reduce configuration overhead
%by $0.3\times$
%for a 125-node ISP topology.

\paragraph{Contributions} We make the following contributions.
\begin{itemize}	
    \item \name, a framework for
	that enforces policies in ``traditional'' (OSPF and BGP) networks
	by synthesizing highly-resilient router configurations. 		
	\name differs from existing approaches in that it uses concrete
	paths to guide the synthesis search instead of directly generating policy-compliant
	configurations.

	\item An algorithm for synthesizing policy-compliant
          configurations with few statically assigned routes. This
          algorithm yields configurations with high network
          connectivity even in the presence of link failures
          (\S~\ref{sec:config-synthesis}).

	\item An algorithm for synthesizing policy-compliant 		
		 configurations that is specialized for waypoint policies. 
		 This algorithm yields configurations that have
		 high policy compliance even in the presence of link failures (\S~\ref{sec:ospfwaypoint}). 
	
	\item A stochastic search mechanism for finding 
		partitions of the network into multiple routing domains which
		yield configurations with higher resilience (\S~\ref{sec:synth-dom-ass}).
	
	\item An implementation of \name together with an evaluation
          of its synthesis algorithms for different topologies and
          workloads, and comparison with a state-of-the-art network
          configuration tool (\S~\ref{sec:evaluation}).
